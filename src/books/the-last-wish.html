                The King of Temeria, Foltest, has offered a reward to anyone who can lift the curse on his daughter
                (the result of an incestuous union with his late sister, Adda), who was born as a striga, and terrorizes

                her if the curse cannot be lifted. Geralt is unsure whether she can live a normal life even if the curse is lifted.
